\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

the task was to
- examine re-placed designs' net lists

- find out if something does not work

- expected: only one or two PIPs are missing due to irreguar structure 
of FPGA

- if problem is encountered, find rule/mask based method to fix these 
missing pips


what we did was:

- handle net by net 

- for each Pin, determine all elements of the isoelectric it is 
connected to (class potential)

- checking method: if (potential(source)!=potential(sink) -> broken


- for broken nets:

 - search isoelectric of source, sink for adjacent, non-set PIPs 
(interesction of sets). if !=empty set, activate this pip


- why it did not work:

  - even for correct (in terms of make file) nets, the method fails

  - hand routing (function of RapidSmith framework) neither does

  - we suspect missing information in fabric;

  - according to the hand router, the method of "isoelectric search" 

results in correct sub nets; might be useful for later work
